# Motivation
Given the current condition around COVID-19 everybody seems to be Working from Home which means taking calls online. Google Meet being one of the most popular video conferencing applications.
While using it I came across the need to mute/unmute my microphone when switching between tabs. This led to building of this chrome extension which helps to mute/unmute your Meet call tab across tabs/windows.

Hope this helps to tidy up your online meeting manners :wink:.
